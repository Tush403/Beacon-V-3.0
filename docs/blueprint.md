## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Desaturated deep blue (#424A85) to evoke a sense of trust and reliability. This darker shade fits a dark color scheme well, aligning with a modern tech aesthetic.
- Background color: Very dark blue (#1A1D2E), almost black, with very low saturation, to ensure good contrast with content in the dark scheme.
- Accent color: Bright purple (#C776D4) as an analogous accent color. It is significantly brighter than the primary, drawing attention to important interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Geist Sans' (sans-serif). Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Utilize 'Lucide React' icons for a consistent and modern look. Ensure icons are intuitive and support easy navigation.
- Design a modern, minimal, and responsive UX using Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and ShadCN UI components. Prioritize a clean and intuitive interface.
- Implement subtle animations to enhance user experience, such as transitions and loading states. Avoid excessive or distracting animations.
